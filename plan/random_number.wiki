  *What defines Success?*
  
  Development Speed!
  
  A clear design that can be used in the example doc
  A test suite to confirm the various parts
  A second repo that will keep the big files out of the miros project
  A complete random number example that demonstrates miros statecharts.

  *What is the problem?*
  
  A lot of moving parts, big files, theory needs to be understood.  Marshalling
  required.
