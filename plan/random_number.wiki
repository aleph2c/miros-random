  *What defines Success?*
  
  Development Speed!
  A clear design that can be used in the example doc
  A test suite to confirm the various parts
  A second repo that will keep the big files out of the miros project
  A complete random number example that demonstrates miros statecharts.

  *What is the problem?*
  A lot of moving parts, big files, theory needs to be understood.  Marshaling
  required.

  * [X] Create Repo
  * [X] Create Doc
  * [X] Move code into new repo
  * [ ] Link cellular automata docs to other repo
  * [ ] Remove cellular automata stuff from miros
  * [ ] Create Test Suite
  * [ ] Move plans into new repo
  * [ ] Update miros to point to new repo... remove cellular automata and random
        files to make it smaller
  * [ ] Port Design Document
  * [ ] Create Development Plan
  * [ ] Update of angle discovery
  * [ ] Automata periodicity discovery
